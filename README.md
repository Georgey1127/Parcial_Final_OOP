This UML diagram shows what the classes will be in the code and what will they do. Each has its attributes and methods for the funcunality of the code. The Theater class will be an ABC that will be the superclass for the other classes. 

Disclaimer: I didn't finish the code I ran out of time, I'm sorry.
